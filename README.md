Dungeons and Weapons is a glorified 'lost and found' simulation in a light fantasy world where you are the lokal tavern keeper, struggling to scratch together enough money to pay your rent. Luckily your tavern has a speciality: an ever shifting dungeon that can be conveniently entered through a portal. In addition to taking an entrance fee for entering the dungeon you also host a shop in your tavern where you sell to your visitors whatever they dropped in your dungeon the day before. 

How long will you be able to keep this cycle up? Will you succumb to the relentless rent payments of succeed and prosper with your business model?

Become a tavern keeper and find out if you are built to last!

## Development
Development started with a game jam over the winter break and was followed by a period of work on the side of my day job for two months straight. The main goal of this project was to deliver my first fully finished product. 
For project layout I decided to go with a folder structure based on components - every component gets a folder on the top level. This decision was taken by choice to see its performance over the course of development. In retro my verdict to this style of project setup is more on the negative side as I fear that this approach does not scale at all with the size of the game. That was to be expected and I can now attest that this organizational structure does not even work for small projects like this game.
